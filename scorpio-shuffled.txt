Business is looking good on the 13th and 14th.
You can always insist you need time to prepare.
Life is sort of funny like that.
Aren't you glad that you resolved those emotional issues before you got slammed at work?
Your approval means a lot to someone special.
Not at all.
The effects of low morale may not be obvious to your boss, but they certainly are to you.
Sometimes decisiveness looks smart, but right now, delving into the options -- and presenting the best of them -- shows you're on top of current thinking and innovation.
Aries is a very physical and pioneering force of nature, so expect your work to involve action and initiative.
It may be a huge domestic disturbance or the beginnings of an uprising at work, but you need to retreat for now."
Change is in the air as you work through challenging relationships and friendships."
Go get 'em!"
The odds are that it doesn't look quite so awesome then."
Your partner might not even realize it, but they're sending you messages that will become more and more clear as the day wears on.
Instead, easily shift from deft debating to charming chitchat and back again.
Take your love life a little more slowly for now."
You need to welcome romantic change with open arms today.
"You'd love to be in love, but that doesn't mean you're going to take the first single candidate to come along.
One moment you're strong-willed and high-powered, but the next you are equivocating or ready to follow without asking questions.
Let your instincts guide you."
"Get over your aversion to uncertainty, at least for the moment.
Be clear with them about what it is that you want on the 25th.
So your willingness to keep on working on that project until it's done -- even though it's the weekend and everyone else just wants to eat, drink and be merry -- won't surprise them.
What to do?
Relinquish control of dinner plans and you'll be pleasantly surprised by what ends up on your plate.
Spread a few favors around, and you'll see them come back to you when you need them most."
"You're feeling fine and funky and ready for a new kind of love.
Shop around a little.
Exercise your mind and your body, and your heart and soul are sure to follow right along."
Why?
Usually your partner can count on you to make swift decisions, but every now and then you're paralyzed by choice (just like everyone else).
"Sometimes it's best to just let the roommates be right.
But do you think it might be time to step off this work-related roller coaster?
This weekend, your stock is up."
Get a friend something sweet, offer a coworker a hand or hold the elevator door for a stranger.
"Everybody loves you -- no matter where you end up going.
"You are feeling a wave of calm pass over you, which should make it a lot easier to exercise the patience you know you need to make it through the day.
If you follow your gut today you're going to find just what you're looking for.
Force yourself to go with the flow and have fun."
"Your need for well-organized plans will be hard to meet for now, as those around you improvise and act spontaneously to seize new opportunities.
Put those practical tendencies aside.
You'll time your performance masterfully, so sweetie might never realize anything's up.
Biting your tongue in a relationship can be more painful than it seems.
The other part of you thinks maybe there are better ways to spend your money this weekend.
It's a really good time for you to show others you know how to kick back."
It seems like an awesome match, though they may be reading comics while you read Shakespeare -- or vice versa.
Thankfully, it doesn't have anything to do with you.
You are smooth as silk now, and you should get along really well with your sweetie no matter how strained things have been recently.
"A book of Eastern philosophy, an Argentine recipe or another foreign artifact will give you a fun, new experience.
"Your mind's likely more on business matters than on the sweet stuff as the week begins, but don't be so preoccupied that you miss the signal a certain someone is sending.
It can be hard for others to keep up with you sometimes.
It's a good time to go trolling for new ideas and contacts, and your coworkers should be able to fill you in.
It's all temporary, and you should be able to find a way to turn these delays into positive outcomes for yourself, your team and your business."
"Your energy is bright and powerful these days and on Monday you're feeling like a new you.
You're feeling shy.
Friday through Sunday, a humble attitude toward others will diffuse tensions."
It has nothing to do with you.)
"Focus on the 1st, and all that you desire will be yours.
But that's no reason to worry.
Go for it!"
"You need to get to the bottom of this!
It's finally safe.
"Every brick wall you encounter today is not meant to be climbed over.
Well, that's just fine.
Be proud of yourselves.
"Before boredom sets in, go in search of some serious excitement -- not just any old entertainment will cut it.
"You need to get in touch with your inner voice.
So why spring for the first thing you see?
If you're feeling a bit more introverted than usual, there are still lovely ways for the two of you to spend the day.
Oddly enough, you'll also need to make some time to tend to the needs of your family members.
"You need to deal with someone who is asking a lot of you -- so make sure that you're up to it.
One thing's for certain: You're sure to enjoy the journey.
Well, it might -- so sit tight and keep quiet.
"In just 24 hours, you'll be under constant supervision -- loving, attentive, wonderful supervision, but supervision, nonetheless.
In real life, of course, monumental movements only happen when you commit to making small changes first.
"Why are others so helpless when faced with your charms right now?
"Daylight will bring a sudden desire to reorganize your room or get new tabs for a binder.
"If you haven't been taking your vitamins lately, you'd better double up on them now.
A choice will be obvious on the extremely excellent 8th and 9th.
Fit in a brainstorming session on Friday or Saturday, when you've got the creative bandwidth to find unusually elegant solutions and come up with innovative new concepts too.
Even if they can't hand you what you need, they may be able to come up with a plan."
If you liked yesterday, you're going to love today.
You need to do some shopping -- for clothes, cosmetics and anything else that will help you make your point.
Cool down!
Lunch and dinner meetings are especially auspicious for you, so see if you can sneak a little business on to the menu."
First, you're easy to get along with (particularly right now).
Ask them to do something low-pressure with you.
Your social life is cooking and opportunities on the work front are occupying most of your brain.
If you're going to act on an impulse today, make sure you're prepared for any possible outcome.
You've had it with furtive glances, masked emotions, clandestine meetings and anything else that even remotely smacks of behind-the-scenes dealings.
Later on you might have to revise them just a bit, but you'll still make great progress."
You may have some big, fun plans in store, but your energy is pushing you to take extra care of your mind and body now, too.
Keeping any secrets, even those that seem small, is hazardous.
"You really need to get it all just right if you want to impress that certain someone special right now.
A drag?
It may be true that money talks, but you need to tell it to keep quiet now.
There's no point in delay -- you know they feel the same, and you know they want to hear it from you.
"Cynicism is the easy way out, and it helps no one in the end.
"Everything you feel will quite literally be written all over your face now.
"Some high-concept excitement may have everyone's head spinning at the beginning of the week, but don't just get caught up in the moment.
A little slacking won't kill anybody, and you could definitely use the break.
Don't worry too much about the specifics -- focus instead on the much-bigger picture.
Starting on Thursday and on into the weekend, you'll be a people-magnet.
Instead, you need to ask if you love yourself.
Wildly delicious daydreams will occur to you all day, but be sure to take pleasure in your present, wonderful state of mind and smooth, joyful life."
Your energy is best spent on getting yourself into shape and keeping yourself there, so make a plan and stick to it!"
Improvement is a continual process.
They won't see you coming, so you can play it loose and casual.
You deserve someone great.
Easy, there.
The chemistry between you and that one hottie is unmistakable.
Hooray!
It might be small and intimate, known only to you and maybe one other person.
It looks like the 1st and 2nd are going to be pretty romantic days for you!
Make your big decision before night falls, as by then, even minor choices are likely to leave you stammering.
In the evening, take the time to think through and write down what you have learned -- watch how great ideas blossom out of small beginnings."
You've got to speak up soon and make sure that your sweetie is okay with everything that's going on.
Is your routine different?
Look to your partner as a sounding board -- they'll offer help.
Something about the way you carry yourself will change slightly.
Just go with the flow -- there's nothing you can do about it anyway, so enjoy this changeable day."
That is what you're after, right?"
Rely on your own charm and wit today.
They'll be a great source of comfort and laughs."
What have you been overlooking?
"Listen up and look with care as the week begins.
Balance is never easy for a Scorpio.
"You need to bust out some big ideas today -- so it's a good thing your imagination is in overdrive!
That doesn't necessarily mean tons of dates, either -- do something indulgent for yourself."
You feel quite happily involved with them.
You may keep talking, but there should be absolutely no argument.
A long, hot shower will leave you feeling better than you have in some time."
Find the various intersections and overlaps, and you're sure to discover something interesting about yourself."
It's going to be a high-energy day for you.
If you live together, expect arguments over small stuff such as groceries or bills; otherwise it's smooth sailing.
"You have to bust out of your current patterns and start making random ones.
They won't be able to articulate what's wrong, but that won't keep you from helping."
By later this afternoon, the only company you really enjoy is your own."
Resist the urge to add to the ambient fireworks on Friday and over the weekend.
Your strong sense of self and fixed ideas of how things should be mean that if you don't make a special effort, you find yourself in a rut."
You need to focus on giving and try not to ask for much of anything right now.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, you let love take its natural course, and it feels great.
Look for a seemingly minor detail that has a big impact on Wednesday or Thursday.
Your relationship with yourself is key.
Which qualities match yours and empower all parties?
That will help more than anything."
Your charm is drawing the right people nearby, but only if you get your ego out of the way (for the time being) and act as a conduit."
Ask around a little about this new love interest -- or ask them yourself directly.
Take this newfound determination and use it to your advantage."
Maybe all of the above is destined to happen."
"Reach out across the office or to a colleague in the industry -- you have the ability to help someone out.
"You are the sun and your friends are the planets; you are their center of gravity.
"Today is perfect for kicking back and letting others take the lead.
"You will most likely find yourself in a bottleneck you can't get out of easily, thanks to coworkers -- or worse -- clients who are determined to move at their own pace.
Beginning Friday and through most of the weekend, your creative juices are ready to flow.
There's a strong chance that they are just insecure.
You're your own master, and sometimes you just need to cut loose and relax.
Fight a good fight, but be willing to find a compromise, too.
There's no sense beating yourself up over indecision -- just calmly weigh the options and trust your conclusions.
It's a good time to get involved in team projects -- let everyone have a piece of the burden and the glory."
"You're ready to travel, to take off for somewhere you've never been, possibly even with someone you've never traveled with before.
Rebirth and regeneration are your themes on Saturday, and Sunday finds you taking risks."
"You've got to take care of something that has been troubling you lately.
All that secret stuff, all those undercover encounters, all those clandestine meetings -- well, they've finally all added up, just like at the end of a murder mystery, when all parties concerned are brought together to reveal 'the culprit.'
Offer one up if you don't already have something cooking, and see how it all goes."
"The powers that be have tossed quite the dilemma your way.
In the meantime, once you've announced your findings, remember that the hero/ine of the thriller always, always ends up with groupies.
But don't fret: Meeting this challenge will reaffirm your faith in yourself and your ability to handle whatever comes your way.
You may need to find someone who's clued in to the weird social vibe moving through your circles before you can understand the subliminal signals coming your way."
"Your family needs you more than they are letting on -- so make sure that you're checking in with them from time to time throughout the day.
Enlist a friend to help you set up a plan for how to get through.
For now.
A deep connection suddenly blossoms between you and someone you've known for ages -- it's a shock!
Don't worry about stepping on anyone's toes, either.
You don't need to know every last thing about your partner -- in fact, you prefer a little mystery.
When you've accomplished more than others dare to dream about (say, by the 3rd), you'll be ready to treat yourself.
It could be someone you haven't spoken with in far too long.
That might not sound like the pinnacle of romance, but tackling your social calendar, snazzing up your dating profile and the like can really pay off."
You are really, really good at what you do.
It's a good day to stay close to them and play as a team.
You may find that your energy feels a bit overextended, but that's all part of the plan.
"You know your middle name?
Take a deep breath and come back down.
"You've got some spare cash rattling around, and the odds are that you slap it down on a lark today.
Your romantic ideas and those belonging to someone close -- maybe a relative -- are just about to clash in a big way.
Don't squander this opportunity!"
Tune in to whatever energies are directing you and you'll have one inspiration after another.
Revamp, regroup and look for a better climate starting Sunday."
Treat them to something surprising -- one of your best qualities is your lack of predictability.
Whether you stick around to see what happens after the show is entirely up to you."
Surf this tide."
Does this mean you should let them take advantage of you and the tender, pensive mood you're in?
Use your powers wisely.
They're preparing to ask for a bit more of your time.
You're feeling restless and the subterranean shifts you've been surfing for the past several months are starting to come to the surface.
Your thoughts on your ideal relationship may have changed, and now probably have a healthy dose of humor mixed in.
"Someone around you will cause trouble.
"A big mystery floats your way today -- and you might be the only one who can solve it.
Romance has staked out some prime real estate in your mind, body and soul -- and no wonder!
"Your easy social energy makes today somewhat sweeter, though you may also find that your friends are a little needier or whinier than usual.
And if you hadn't done something praiseworthy, no one would be trying to praise you, right?
"Are you ready to be in charge?
You may want to stage a dramatic hissy fit as an excuse to kiss and make up, but go ahead and skip right to the kissing part.
Consider how you sound, and consider holding back a bit more than usual.
Indulge in the classics: Romantic moonlight, soft music and a delicious dinner can go to your head tonight.
You've got some good people on your side when it comes to getting new ideas, so work them for all they're worth."
"Interruptions and distractions will get in the way of your daily routine, but try to stay flexible and open-minded about it all.
Then smooch!
You're great at making decisions, but what about your darling?
So what are you waiting for?
Thus, you'll be a little out of sync with your peers.
So stay on your toes.
Neptune, the planet of soulful unions and fairytale-worthy dalliances enters your romance sector this April.
If it goes poorly, they can bear the burden, and if it goes well, you're on board.
They'd do whatever you say.
It's just that two people are making such huge demands you can't possibly accommodate both of them at once.
And these qualities extend into all areas of your life.
"Somebody's ego just grew a few sizes -- is it yours?
"Your senses go far beyond the merely physical, though you're most likely no one's psychic friend.
It starts out quietly enough, and you may just bounce along for a while until a surge of energy hits you early in the afternoon.
Plans you make for later in the day are favored."
You know that where there's a will, there's a way.
Try to scale back your goals and milestones until everyone is more or less on the same page.
Most likely, a positive attitude is the source of that energy; find new ways to show it.
Things are kind of blurry!"
Get out there and share your heart's energy with all kinds of people: family, your mate, coworkers, friends and complete strangers.
Is it how your happiness rings out like a bell?"
You can't own anybody!"
That way you can overcome objections and obstacles while learning how to be as flexible as a yogi.
You know how to confidently hold your ground without turning it into trench warfare.
Write a poem or paint a picture to let them know just how romantic you feel on the 11th, 12th and 13th.
When this period passes, you'll be sure you're right about everything that's been happening -- and ready to act."
Just let your loved ones know the news as gently as possible.
In the meantime, you could end up with some really lovely communications that are a bit more fit for public knowledge.
Wednesday and Thursday, if the problem persists, apply your imagination toward solving it.
You may not have to act on this knowledge, but you'll know what to do if you should.
It might be best to play around with the subject a little before throwing anything or anyone over the side.
"A popular coworker may be getting more attention than they deserve but acting jealous or moody won't help you get noticed.
And spend time planning some fun -- romantic fun -- for Saturday and Sunday."
Deep doesn't always mean heavy, so make it meaningful instead of weighted down with expectations."
How will you-know-who know what you have in mind until you say it?
You'll find your own way out -- sooner rather than later.
Open your arms to expectations."
That self-confidence of yours is hot indeed, and you've definitely got the power of love right now.
"If your boss is driving you nuts, make fun plans for after work to blow off steam.
Start planning your next move -- and think about its effects on your career.
Investigate everything you can!
"Make a move -- there's no reason not to!
Eventually they should get bored and try to hassle someone else."
"Something's holding you back.
Wednesday and Thursday are better days, more fun, but still, everything happens in a minor key.
Listen to yourself when you talk about love, and you'll learn something surprising."
Choose an area of your life and start remodeling it.
It could be that someone else gets to them first, though -- so move!"
"You finally get what you really want -- do you know what it is?
"'A family in harmony will prosper in everything,' so says a Chinese proverb.
Things won't be as bad as you fear, and you might actually learn something cool about Sweetie -- and yourself.
That doesn't mean you need to put off going home until tomorrow, just that you need to handle an added conflict with grace."
Your partner has something to say to you, but they might be waiting or trying to say it in code.
Tonight is full of all kinds of fun activities, so buck up and get moving.
Find someone else who needs a rest and play together.
Try to skew it toward the positive by making sure you're among friends -- or at least people predisposed to liking you.
Cleaning and organizing will be time well spent, especially when it comes to improving your outlook on your job."
As the day develops, you'll start to see why.
It's normal for human beings to want things they can't have, but it's possible that you're being selfish about this: You have no idea what's going on in this person's interior life.
"If you're involved in something new -- a gig, a sweetie, an artistic endeavor, whatever -- remember that you can count on your people to help you move forward with it.
A funny little bit of information about your honey is available to you now, if only you take a moment to look.
You might score some serious cash out of it, or maybe your cred will pop up into the stratosphere.
Maybe so, if it's an important one.
Your energy doesn't let you push it now.
"Today's issues are especially polarized, so there's no shame in taking a stand and sticking to it.
Slurp up some ice cream, shake your tail feathers ...
"You can keep yourself reined in today -- it's easy.
Or furniture.
You'll have plenty of time to pout tomorrow."
"You're ready to draw a line in the sand and defend your free time against all encroachers -- and there will be a few of them.
Let the situation unfold and just see where it's heading.
Thursday returns you to more everyday tasks.
Someone might take your words the wrong way, but you can clear it up later.
If you haven't already dealt with it and resolved old business, do so today -- fasten your seat belt and prepare!
Around Wednesday and Thursday, confine your competitive instincts to work; love's not a game, and if it feels like it is, you may need to readjust your perspective.
"Tell the world how you feel!
"Your unconscious mind is working overtime, but it's causing all kinds of little blips in your perceptions.
Wait until you get more data from your sweetie before making any decisions about what to do next.
Before you tear down a wall or drop too much cash, you may want to consider a few things: the time and money you have available, for starters -- and what you'll do if you don't stay in this mood long enough to fix that gaping hole in your dining room.
Those who know and love you have also seen how you get when you're really intent on finishing something.
That goes for most, if not all circumstances.
Being yourself this weekend will pay off though -- in ways you'd never imagined."
It's time for you to let one tiny detail slip -- maybe that crazy stunt you pulled once that was totally out of character, or that talent you've got that only rarely (but wonderfully) comes into play."
You will be quick-witted and articulate -- a certain degree of sympathy for your listeners is essential as well.
Jump on it!
It really shouldn't take you 20 minutes to make up your mind.
Now is not the time for big risks.
You can go the what-you-see-is-what-you-get route -- or you can choose a bit more mystery, and even a little finesse.
"You thought you were done with all your shopping, but suddenly, you've remembered what you forgot -- or should we say 'who' you forgot.
"The underdog will have all of your sympathy right now -- even if you're the top dog.
So is the 26th.
"Others may not have your cataloging and organizing abilities, but remember to respect their opinions on other matters.
It's not that hard, but you may need to exert some effort."
Why not celebrate?"
Things will definitely be interesting, and a big change might be on the way.
"Let loose creatively -- you need to feel the flow!
If it worked out this time, great -- but don't press your luck!
Though you are sometimes rather prone to extremes, right now you've actually got sound a way to make sweet music in the middle, which is  useful for anything related to your love life!"
Even the seemingly insignificant details have meaning, so don't let anything get past you (and pay attention to your most minor moves, too).
If you want the boss to give you and only you control of the soap suds campaign, say so on the 8th and 9th.
"Find a way to promote your vision of the future -- it shouldn't be hard on a day like today.
You know how you are when you're mulling things over, and keeping busy with mindless tasks is the best way to make your decision."
Just don't get too crazy.
It's way too easy to grouch about how hard life is now, but when was it ever easy?
How convenient for sleeping in late the next day!
You won't know if they're feeling that same way until you ask, of course -- and that necessarily involves asking them."
"You of all people understand the power of the right approach.
"Nobody but nobody likes to suffer.
Make sure you have the ear of your supervisor or someone high up on the food chain, then let loose.
Spill the important stuff and save the surprises for lovely little romantic moments.
Before you know what's happening, you may be deep in conversation with someone you hardly know -- so why not bring up the good stuff from down deep?
Who knows?
"A radical change is on the horizon in your home life.
Use your natural speed and clever brain to engage them instead of simply dismissing their concerns.
"You might have some troubles with those who disagree with you, even on a superficial level.
But you've learned that others aren't quite so skilled at it, so you're not ordinarily confident about believing everything you hear.
You like it so much better than another cheap geegaw."
All this work with nature might cause some new emotions to bloom."
A lot of pressing things are underway, and you play a crucial role.
That, and an intact conscience."
Who knows -- the more you up the ante, the more you might find you like it.
That's quite a talent you've got there -- maybe you could teach it to a few of your more gossipy pals!"
You are a pillar of patience.
Whatever else you've got going on, reprioritize so you can heat things up with your honey.
Your partner will most likely follow along with your decisions today, thanks to your almost hypnotic charm.
Do you see them sweating the small stuff?
You've either done the footwork or you haven't -- only you know.
Congratulations -- get ready to celebrate."
"Tempers and passions are both ablaze simultaneously.
"Your right brain is fully engaged today, drawing clues out of seemingly insignificant details.
Prudence is the better avenue."
It may be something of a sacrifice for you, but it will also absolve you of responsibility.
Sometimes you have to make a split decision as to what you're going to be.
Turn some of that frantic action into deep thought.
Your job could be on the line."
Follow your instincts but be a bit conservative."
"Your energy is flowing strongly through mind and body today, leading you to take new risks that should pay off for you.
"It's not like you to run ahead like this.
You may discover a new favorite food!"
Assess your budget first, then start prioritizing."
If you're looking, celebrate the possibilities."
Others may help out when they see your passion."
After all, you love them because they're wonderful.
The right person who challenges you intellectually and fulfills you emotionally is out there.
At the moment, though, you amaze even yourself with how much you enjoy chatting with almost anyone on pretty much any topic.
Pat yourself on the back (nobody else is going to do it for you) and get going.
You might need to check in with them earlier than you think.
"You're feeling very jolly these days and embracing it with impressive abandon.
You're good at that."
In circumstances beyond your control, you may find yourself talking to someone you never would have considered talking to before.
The second half of the week, particularly Wednesday and Thursday, your self-control and shrewdness will be called upon, and Friday you may need to finesse something over the phone.
That doesn't just mean paying attention to others.
The novelty of travel is what you need right now.
It's easy to put a crush up on a pedestal, but it's also dangerous.
"You've often been called obsessive, which is certainly true, though you need to remember to see the positive side of it -- the fact that obsession is really just extremely focused concentration!
It may be time for you to make your ambitions plain for all to see, though you should expect some push-back."
Don't expect your friends to solve your problem for you.
Hey, it happens to the best.
If you can blow off other responsibilities you won't regret it.
"Use your superpowers to zip through your work or chores today -- you've got far more going on than others realize.
"One of the secrets you hide so well is that you love secrets (and intrigue and mysteries) -- provided, of course, some romance is at the root of it all.
"Working from home will go well for you, especially if you're composing communications or negotiations.
Though it might feel impossible not to cling tightly onto something or someone, wouldn't your life be much easier if you could just loosen your grip a bit more?
You and your sweetheart should be able to find a place you both want to see -- and the planning will be easy!
You will be able to see just what is needed and ought to be able to serve it up to sweetie before being asked.
Think carefully about the results you're after -- you don't want the wrong message to get out there."
It could go nowhere fast, or it could go as well as any romantic comedy could ever ask for -- it's worth the risk!"
"You can bring new things to life today -- it's easy for you!
If you find a way to give in without giving up ground, you can come out ahead in the very long run."
"It's no wonder that your mind is a loose collection of images and feelings at the start of the week -- the dreamy quality of the season does that.
It's all about undercover encounters and enticing partners.
Your diligence is its own reward, of course -- but you'll be glad to hear you're due for a little unexpected bonus right now.
You're so focused on improving your love life that you can forget the most important part: enjoying what's here right now.
Ask a question or two before you act or react!
You'll get a fresh sense of energy that'll boost your relationship, too.
Sometimes you need to assert yourself."
From Monday evening through Wednesday, you might still find yourself at odds with the ideas and agendas of others, but the competition is apt to be much more good-natured and spirited.
Sometimes you're too close to your own life."
"Open communication is vital today, and you need to make sure that all lines are open this morning.
"Creativity is foremost in your heart and soul right now, so make sure you carve out some time to spend on your own.
Something great is in the works!"
Things might heat up (in a touchy way) before they warm up, so be patient.
A change in attitude can work wonders for your mood.
You know more than you think you do!"
"Don't hesitate to communicate and socialize today, especially over food.
There's nothing dull or ordinary in the work you'll encounter but with so many new elements involved you could easily be getting in over your head.
And they know how to be creative.
Try to keep it on the down low early, then venture out in the afternoon."
It's time for comfort food, favorite movies and cozy slippers.
"Every stray scent distracts you today.
Are you crazy?
You're feeling imaginative -- more so than usual -- and may want to try something new with your sweetheart.
"Keeping your head down and your eyes on the road like an ox pulling a cart will allow you to finish up your homework, but it will also show you the little flowers by the roadside.
Give yourself room to grow."
Or else!
"You might feel a little exposed on the home front when word gets out about your latest success, but don't be shy about speaking your mind.
"Stop banging your head against the wall!
You don't have to take anyone's rudeness, but you also don't have to make a federal case out of it."
But do read the whole thing very carefully first.
"You need people to help you get what you're looking for.
"Isn't it satisfying when you suddenly understand a concept that's eluded you forever?
"You don't hide the fact that you're ambitious, though you may hide your particular ambitions from time to time.
It's a good time to start a new journey."

It takes a lot of bravery to trust, and you could get hurt.
Now is the perfect time for the two of you to make plans for the future -- even just next weekend.
Use it to make sure both of you are happy.
Planning on moving to a more expensive apartment?
"It's a great time to make lists -- resolutions, anyone?
Then go out and get it on the 30th!
Make sure your setup is ergonomically in order, and find a way to get both the privacy and the input you need from others.
If you're experiencing resistance, don't push.
Is everything adding up?
Your heart and your head can't seem to agree on Monday and Tuesday and this might be a better time to think than act (especially if you can count on some back-and-forth banter with friends).
So sniff it, poke it and look under the hood.
Not only does this enhance all first impressions, it also gives you the ability to think quickly on your feet.
After all, they do the same for you!"
You may learn new tricks or use an under-appreciated skill."
You'll make some real progress without drawing too heavily on your resources."
But let's not forget that you're getting those pats on the back for a reason.
After all, if you can imagine it clearly, you know better which direction to head in!
In the meantime, expect to endure at least one more conversation with the same person -- yes, over the same issue -- before it's all over.
You're unstoppable, though who would want to stop you when you're this great?
It might not come in the mail or in the form of a giant novelty check, but luck has definitely shifted in your favor.
Let them go.
If you let things evolve organically now -- particularly when it comes to friends and those who might turn into something more -- something real could emerge."
Crank up the radio."
"You and everyone around you have been involved in a lot of positive discussions, but there's been little progress in the areas that really need it.
Listen!"
Someone's attempt to get your attention is a major misfire.
"You've always had high standards, but some overly meticulous celestial influences could have you going from picky to persnickety, especially when it comes to office matters.
You're feeling dreamy and brainy during the day, and your imaginative and intellectual powers are all fired up.
You won't be able to rest until it's all done, and you know how you get when you decide you're going to finish something."
Someone really understands you -- and understands your current romantic dilemma even better.
"You know that big project you've had kinda-sorta-not-really in the back of your mind?
You're back to feeling mighty intense about the relationship, and with any luck your honey is right on your wavelength.
"Life is something of a mystery right now, but you can certainly handle it -- in fact, you may thrive on it!
However, that is only very rarely the case.
Know when to stop and reconsider current circumstances in light of longer-term goals.
You're feeling it to the nth degree, and you absolutely can't help yourself from allowing the fullest expression of those feelings.
"It's the old guard versus the new folks in a power struggle that will help define the mission of your business for some time.
If they're not yours yet, expect that to change pretty soon."
If they're on your team, gently get them back on track.
Travel, anticipation, romance: It could all be just what the doctor ordered."
In this case, your long-term interests will most likely be better served by sticking with the devil you know than running toward seemingly greener grass."
"If an old friend or significant other has been on your mind lately, there could be a good reason for that.
Your passion, is back and it doesn't just apply to someone you find seriously attractive.
Try to see the intention behind what someone says or does, even if the result comes out a little abrasively.
You're feeling especially close to a friend right now.
Then you can regroup and see things more clearly."
At least, you should be able to move yourself forward in one way or another."
Trust your gut instincts and don't be afraid to act impulsively or get caught up in the moment!"
Then, around Friday and Saturday, you need to engage your instincts when it comes to matters of the heart.
You might feel like you have a lot going on -- and a lot of people really are making unreasonable demands --- but you can handle the craziness.
When the urge to go all-out to impress them with your emotional depth hits you, go for it.
"Avoiding conflict isn't really your thing -- you'd much rather have it out and move on.
Besides, Tuesday and Wednesday will be so full of activity completely outside the home realm that you may forget about everything else, at least for a short while.
At the very least, form a plan for handling them."
At the same time, try to revamp your social calendar with some wild, unusual events.
In fact, there aren't too many other signs that could even come close, much less match it.
"You don't have to wrestle with this one alone.
"Your morning should begin on a pleasantly upbeat note, especially if you take some time to get attuned to your inner thoughts.
Add your own deliberately positive energy for great results, especially when it comes to love.
Seriously good news brightens your days on the 21st and 22nd.
"Go ahead and give yourself a pat on the back.
"Snuggle!
Proclaiming your feelings at maximum volume might feel freeing, but your energy requires a more subtle approach today.
Go ahead.
You have a carefully planned schedule, and you like it that way, but unfortunately, since you're not alone on the planet, paths often intersect and you're forced to change course.
"You're a seeker of knowledge of all kinds, from the physical to the emotional and mental.
Though you may feel as if someone's being aloof and terrible, try an intellectual approach.
You're bewitching, so be aware of the spells you're capable of putting 'em under.
"Be very careful with your spending right now -- the numbers are deceiving.
"An authority figure might arouse your wrath today, but think before you respond.
Bring it out in full force today and have some harmless fun with other cute witty folk.
"Quick!
But beware: Work issues, especially the interpersonal ones, look extremely tricky on Friday, and stress is likely.
If it's clean already, use the day to get organized somewhere else around the house -- your closet or desk, perhaps?"
"Your friends are clamoring for you right now -- even if you can't hear their calls!
Today's not the day for making long-term financial commitments.
In the evening, take some time to celebrate with friends or family.
Whatever you plan today has a double seal of approval from the stars."
"Your senses are more open to new input today, and you should find that you're better able to piece together clues coming your way.
If sweetie has an authoritarian side, it's likely to come out today -- and you're likely to resent it in a big way.
It's not such a bad thing, really, especially if they're doing the same thing.
"A secret that means a lot to you makes the first few days of the week a little extra special for you and one other person.
"Words that are meant to be constructive might be interpreted otherwise, so try to make sure everything you say has only one possible meaning.
"You and your ego may need to sit down for a talk today -- it's just getting in your way, but you don't quite feel comfortable breaking up with it.
You'll have a way better time than you'd think.
You'll get another reminder that you're in the right line of work -- or that you need to forge a new career path.
You may not like what you hear initially, but the truth will set you free."
Buckle down and do your work.
Shop around.
Why stay in one place when you can create some fabulous romantic energy out of pure ether?
"One of the best gifts you offer the world is your sparkling wit!
What are you doing with all that sizzle?
Get ready for a super stellar wrap to the year on the 29th, 30th and 31st.
"Whatever you're feeling?
It's a good idea for you to kick back and let them drive for the time being.
On the other hand, you kind of wish they would change.
A small risk is one thing, and a great big huge crazy-insane risk is another.
"You're experiencing some weird family issues right now, most likely with those older than you.
Set your course quickly and put your plans into action as soon as possible to make the most of this new romantic possibility.
Indulge in earthly pleasures, whether that means taking a long hike in the woods or cooking something impossibly decadent.
If you push forward now, you'll make excellent progress and leave all the discord behind."
In fact, you may already be doing this job, and not getting the credit or financial remuneration due you.
"Every sign is known for traits that are 'universal' -- some as true and some as false as ethnic stereotypes.
If you want to boost your attractiveness, your energy demands extra activity to give you an extra glow.
Multifaceted doesn't even begin to describe you.
Your hermitlike sentiment also makes conversation hard.
Even if it isn't, you'll have a great time.
More sassy than fighty, and just as able to take it as to dish it out.
Openness is vital -- don't let yourself hide anything, no matter how sensitive."
One or more of your creative solutions might be worth instituting as policy."
(This week is about giving, remember?)
"If you'd rather be at home, don't try to be the life of the party.
Someone new fascinates you so much now that you actually consider opening the ranks for them.
You might also want to consider the fact that someone could be trying to arrange a wonderful surprise for you.
It may be good or bad, but you need to be open about it.
"Work is worrying you on Monday -- something's up with the boss.
Take time out to regroup and recharge, even if it's just a brief respite from your schedule.
"The extra hours and energy you've been putting in lately are starting to pay off professionally -- not so much personally.
Prepare for competition around Thursday and Friday.
"Engage someone in a deep conversation -- they are sure to stimulate a part of your brain that needs it badly.
Singletons, meanwhile, are bold -- and utterly beautiful to the right person.
See if you can find a way to relax the tension without giving up ground.
"Things are nearly perfect at work -- your clients are happy, your coworkers are staying out of your hair and your supervisors smile when they see you.
You might decide to let go of a lot more!"
"A charismatic person will challenge the way you think about the ideals underlying your business.
"Tell your supervisor exactly what's on your mind.
Even if they could, they wouldn't want to."
It's as good a day as any to scrub those dingy corners and rearrange all those nasty binders.
You just so happen to be in the mood to socialize too!
"The big boss makes the whole office shake when walking down the hallway.
Friday stands a good chance of being an easy day, as long as you're patient and aware.
"Follow a sudden notion or unusual idea on Monday.
It's way more romantic to do all that hard work than to project your insecurities on perfectly lovely love partners, too, by the way.
Evading whatever sneakiness they're cooking up shouldn't be a problem, and you'll come out of it smelling like a rose."
And on the 8th, you might well just hit one.
Love's complicated, but it's not that difficult to figure out -- especially considering the added insight you'll gain on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
Make big, ambitious plans for this evening.
Magnetism, energy and strength bolster your already formidable talents.
"Your love life could use a boost -- and today's fantastic emotional energy is just what it needs!
You may need to take responsibility for someone else for a bit."
Your energy demands caution in all business and financial matters, so make sure everything is in order before you sign on the dotted line -- or any other kind of line, for that matter.
You should!
But what is drawing all these would-be Lotharios-or-Lotharias to your side is something else, too: Your inner beauty.
Knowledge is power today, especially when it comes to your love life.
Good energy is on your side today when it comes to devising smart communications or putting together awesome plans -- all of which is quite valuable when it comes to romance.
Or has time at home never been a part of your routine?
The two of you may be so diametrically opposed about an issue that the hope of ever meeting in the middle seems slight.
You'll make connections you never thought possible."
"Thinking about buying a new car today?
Everything goes your way on the 17th and 18th.
"On the one hand, you really want things to continue as they are.
Maintain a bit of reserve and only say what you know for sure."
You surely love the idea of trying something new, but don't get too far out.
"You need to draw some attention to yourself, for better or for worse.
You might be surprised at how this all turns out."
Now, if this is a potential relationship, be sure it won't interfere with your career before you take the next step.
Crushes are fun, so let yourself enjoy this one."
It's a good time to really try to change things for the better!
Don't put off for tomorrow emotional work you could do today.
Sometimes a person just has to stake out their territory when it comes to romance.
"You're the kind of person who insists on depth, intensity and passion in all your encounters, so anyone who wastes your time with meaningless chatter won't garner a second conversation.
You're nearly irresistible -- and you could have people lined up around the block for a chance to get close to you."
It's a good time for a little readjustment, so see if you can make a quick switch while no one is looking."
Try to cast a wide net and look for the anomalies that highlight how your current paradigm needs to change.
"Art holds some serious appeal to you today, even if you consider yourself deeply materialistic.
Get busy."
Present the facts calmly and let them figure everything else out on their own.
Go away?
Expect to learn from experience.
"In addition to an intense positive energy, you are full of sex appeal.
Get what you need, while you're at it!"
Listen to those you deal with regularly about their opinions and aspirations, and try to integrate them into your own thinking."
"Uh-oh!
"You're dreaming of travel, and it could happen sooner than you think.
Don't worry about it.
"Sharp intellectual curiosity has you reading the news and international blogs, but don't forget the people right around you.
Your peers are amazed at what looks like prescience!"
A burst of inspiration will help you sort through all the conflicting hopes and dreams, showing you what you really want out of life.
You don't have a chance to think about anything related to yourself.
If you're not even sure what the 'iron' stands for, don't worry -- all you need to know is that the time is right for daring and swift action.
"You're in a hurry to get projects under way or plans enacted, but the stars may not be in your favor now -- at least when it comes to new initiatives.
